     <h2>Personal Training</h2>

     <p>A personal trainer will teach you everything you need to know about exercising. Sometimes all we need is a little more support. Your personal trainer can set realistic goals based on your abilities and make adjustments where necessary. A personal trainer will challenge you and take you to the next level. No two workouts days will be the same, making each day fun and new with plenty of variety. Personal trainers will coach, push, and motivate you more than you may be able to yourself. Personal trainer will start you out with small goals that will eventually lead to your final goal and show you exactly how to get there.
          Working with a trainer allows you the freedom to create your own workout schedule.</p>

             <h2>Body Building</h2>
 
             <p>Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's musculature (muscle building) by muscle hypertrophy for aesthetic purposes. 
                 It is distinct from similar activities such as powerlifting because it focuses on physical appearance instead of strength. An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder.
                  In professional bodybuilding, competitors appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank them based on symmetry, muscularity, size, conditioning, posing, and stage presentation.
                   Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the elimination of nonessential body fat, enhanced at the last stage by a combination of extracellular dehydration and carbo-loading, to achieve maximum muscular definition and vascularity; they also tan and shave to accentuate the contrast of their skin under the spotlights.</p>

        <p>Typically, those who want to gain weight should focus on gaining muscle. It's usually healthier to gain most of your weight as muscle rather than fat. While food and exercise are most important for gaining muscle, supplements may also help by providing calories and protein or by allowing you to exercise harder.</p>
