                The most popular version is performed on a flat bench with the elbows locked over the head (hence the name),
                 but it's also great on a decline or incline bench.</b></p>

                Perform this movement first or second in your workout. Do 3-4 sets of 6-10 reps. If you're going heavy, don't hesitate to use wrist wraps for extra support.

            <p><b>Dips are a proven mass-builder on their own. Their only problem: Lots of people can't do enough reps to get within the ideal muscle-building rep range of 8-12 reps. Either that, or they can do way too many. In the former case, use the assisted dip/pull-up machine or a band. In the latter, add weight with a dip belt or a light dumbbell between your knees or feet.</b></p>

                The best and safest way to load up is to have a partner place weights across your lap. Intensity boosters like dropsets are easy to do: just remove a plate to extend your set.</b></p>
