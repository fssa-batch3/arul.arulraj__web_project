            <p><b>The standard shoulder-width curl engages the short and long heads of the biceps equally, you can alter grip width to slightly change the emphasis (wide to target the short head, narrow for the long head), you can really pile on the weight, and you don't have to sit there endlessly working one arm at a time.</b></p>

            <p>BENIFITS</p>
            <p><b>This movement seems a lot like the standing barbell curl at first glance. After all, they're both bilateral movements in which you take a shoulder-width, underhand grip on the bar. What makes it different is that, like all of the best muscle-building cable exercises, the angle of loading gives you constant tension on the muscle through the full range of motion.</b></p>

            <p><b>Is this really any different than a barbell curl? That's up to you. Sure, you can do the moves in basically the same way in the same workout, but we don't recommend it. The real value of dumbbell curls is that they can be done a number of ways: standing or seated, with both arms or alternating.In shirt,you have options.</b></p>

                <p><b>Curls with a palms-facing or neutral grip do more than just hit the biceps, they also heavily recruit the brachialis, a muscle that doesn't get measured on EMG studies because it's beneath the biceps. Because it's not as obvious a move as, say, a barbell curl, it often gets undeservedly skipped on arm day.</b></p>

                <p><b> This is detail work, not the main course! Perform these after an exercise like standing curls, in which both biceps heads are targeted with heavy weight.
                     Because of the "overstretched" arm position at the bottom of the movement, it's best done with relatively light weights and at least 8-12 reps per set.</b></p>
