            <p><b>Bench presses can be used to increase strength, improve endurance, and tone the muscles of the upper body, including the chest, arms, and shoulders.1 to 3 times per week could help optimize strength gains.

                However, the number of times that you should perform a bench press per week depends on your personal goals and fitness routine.</b></p>

            <p><b>This workout help for improve your upper chest.Not only is the incline bench press a classic way to build the upper chest, many lifters find them to be a more comfortable "main lift" for the shoulders than flat benching. It's great with a barbell or multi-grip bar, but maybe be even better with dumbbells, since you can customize your grip to increase focus on the upper pecs.</b></p>

            <p><b>Whether dumbbell or barbell presses are better for growth is an age-old weight-room debate. Luckily, you can do both! But there's little doubt that the dumbbell variation has more versatility throughout the beginning, middle, and end of a chest workout.</b></p>

            <p><b>The common thinking on decline is that it's for lower chest only. And while it is good for that, all-time greats, like six-time Mr. Olympia Dorian Yates in his 6-Week Blood and Guts program, favor it because it hits the entire chest and allows them to lift heavier and more comfortably than the flat bench.</b></p>

                <p><b>Free-weight pressing moves on a flat bench are great, but machine press and cable press variations have some unique benefits. For one, it's easier to slow down the repetition, both in the concentric and eccentric phases. Stack-loaded machines are also great for quickly doing dropsets.</b></p>

                <p><b>An obvious point in favor of push-ups is that they require no equipment and can be the centerpiece of a home chest workout,Sets of push-ups to failure are a great way to burn out or add volume in the late stages of a workout, and they're awesome in a compound set with dips, a mechanical dropset after flyes or presses,
                     or an antagonist chest-and-back superset with rows.</b></p>

                <p><b>Dips were a staple in the training programs of the golden-age greats for good reason: Nothing stretches the chest and makes it work quite like this bodyweight movement.
                     You can add extra weight with a dip belt if you're seriously strong, or use band or machine assistance if you struggle with bodyweight reps.
                      Plus, they are a great spotter-free alternative to the decline press.</b></p>

                    <p><b>Pull-overs have been a favorite torso builder of bodybuilders for decades. Dating back to the 1940s and earlier, lifters alternated them with 20-rep squats in workouts designed to expand the ribcage.
                         The logic behind this approach may not stand up today, but the move is still worth including on a modern chest day.</b></p>

                    <p><b>For the majority of lifters, the machine chest fly (aka, pec-deck) is a more effective, harder-to-screw-up alternative to dumbbell flyes. 
                        If your gym has one,it's a great move to get a great pump without having to balance any weights or put your shoulders at risk.
                        As a pre-exhaust, hit a few sets of 10-15 before your presses.</b></p>
